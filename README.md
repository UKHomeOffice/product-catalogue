# Product Catalogue

Product catalogue offers a time based versioning system for "products". Loosely a product is something that you can "apply" for, for example a Visa or a Drivers License. The concept of a product is to map the questions that people are asked when applying for a product back to the reason why they need to be asked. It is not a place to define what questions should be asked but why they are being asked (e.g. back to policy or legislation or law references). As policy changes or fee change new versions of products can be activated and the catalogue provides the API for that.
